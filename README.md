# Photo Renamer for iPhone photos

This script renames JPG photos in current folder with a timestamp derived from EXIF data. The goal is to rename files with the format IMG_YYYYMMDD_hhmmss_suffix so that these photos can be stored in time sorted order with photos from other devices.

<b>This script lacks a confirmation to rename</b>
